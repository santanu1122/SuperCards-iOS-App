iOS App: SuperCards
An iphone app where users can buy cards with in-app purchase.
They can design, customize and embed video, music and other things.
Cards designed on the phone are formatted for large view monitors to make a beautiful scene when the cards are oppened.
However, they are shrunk as best as possible using layer manipulation to make them nicely viewable on iphones/ipads.

After cards are customized they are sent via a contact list pop up and to email, txtmsg, facebook, twitter etc.
The Final Card view url will be sent to the receiver and the receiver can choose to share the card or keep it private, and send a thank you or other personal message back to the sender.
who receives the notification on their iphone with the message.

SideNote:
This is a companion project to the website where affilite artists log in and submit their art/cards for entry into this iphone app where sales/purchases of the cards are split with the artist.
